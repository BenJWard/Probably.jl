# Probably.jl Documentation


*probabilistic data structures in Julia*


Probably.jl provides an implementation of common probabilistic data structures that are:


  * Written in pure Julia
  * Both fast and memory-efficient
  * Good for default or casual use cases, easy to use in other projects
  * Manipulated via functions with names from Julia's Base library


This package does not attempt to provide:


  * A lot of functionality
  * Structures optimized for different use cases

  * Bloom filter
  * Cuckoo filter
