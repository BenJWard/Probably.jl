# Probably.jl Documentation
_probabilistic data structures in Julia_

Probably.jl provides an implementation of common probabilistic data structures that are:
- Written in pure Julia
- Both fast and memory-efficient
- Good for default or casual use cases, easy to use in other projects
- Manipulated via functions with names from Julia's Base library

This package does not attempt to provide:
- A lot of functionality
- Structures optimized for different use cases

## Package features
Probably.jl currently includes the following data structures:
 - Bloom filter
 - Cuckoo filter
 - Count-min sketch
 - Hyperloglog
