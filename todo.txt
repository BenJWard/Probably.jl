For bloom filter, countminsketch, make a COMMON constructor interface.
Need to be able to specify any two of three: fpr, memory consumption, capacity.

Example: FastCuckoo(memory=100_000_000, fpr=0.001)

Add tests an ddocs

Description:
All of these should:
Use sane defaults, allowing casual use (else people would implement their own)
Be high performance
Use the function names in Base if possible

We don't care about:
Tons of functionality
Optimizing for many different use cases
